# Description

There is a list of products that can be purchased on the app dashboard. The products added to the cart can be viewed by clicking on the appropriate icon in the header.
Once the shopping cart section is open, the products can be removed one at a time or you can proceed with the purchase by clicking on "Buy now". By finalizing the purchase you are redirected to the order page, here you will find a list of all the orders placed by the user, which, if necessary, can be deleted.
The number of products available in the dashboard is updated every time an order is placed or deleted

# Local installation

To proceed with the installation locally, you need to pull the project. After obtaining a copy of the project, the MYSQL database must be initialized through the "dotshop.sql" file and, furthermore, an .env file with the credentials for the database must be created. Afterwards, you need to go to the / Api folder, where the php backend of the project is present, and initialize the php server with the command "ng serve --open".
Finally you have to go to the / DotShop-fe folder, in which you have to type two commands: "npm install" to install node modules and "ng serve --open" to open the app in the browser.
